> *This project has been inactive for a few months. The bot remains available on Telegram, and I will occasionally fix bugs as they arise. If the project gets more traction in the form of stars, then I will consider updating and improving this project. This project requires regular maintenance, as it might break for specific websites if the structure changes.*
